# Climate-Change-Impacts-on-Solar-PV-Efficiency-and-Power-Generation-in-India
This research analyzes NASA NEX-GDDP climate data to assess the effects of rising temperatures on solar PV efficiency in India under SSP126 and SSP585 scenarios. Northern regions like Jammu and Kashmir maintain stable efficiency, while southern areas face declines of 0.3%-0.5% per degree Celsius rise, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies.
# Research Question
What are the expected impacts of future temperature changes on solar power production
in India due to climate change?

# Introdcution
Climate change brings rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns, leading to significant socio-economic challenges. For instance, during a heatwave in 2021, Delhi experienced widespread power outages, emphasizing the vulnerability of the electricity grid. To mitigate these impacts, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is crucial. In India, where high temperatures and a growing population drive increased energy demand, sustainable solutions are essential. 
Currently, India's energy mix consists of approximately 55% coal, 17% renewables (including 10% from solar), 12% natural gas, and 16% nuclear. Although solar only contributes around 10% of the total energy generation at present, its share is steadily growing as India continues to prioritize renewable energy expansion. India is geographically well-suited for solar energy, with abundant sunshine throughout the year, particularly in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh, making them ideal for solar energy expansion. Hence, the country shows great potential for scaling up solar production. 
India primarily relies on two types of solar energy production-solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP)-with PV being the dominant and more efficient technology due to its lower cost, scalability, and better performance in diverse geographic conditions across the country. India's solar photovoltaic (PV) sector has seen remarkable growth in recent years. As of 2023, India has installed a solar capacity of approximately 68 gigawatts (GW), making it one of the largest solar markets in the world. The country aims to achieve 280 GW of solar capacity by 2030 as part of its commitment to renewable energy expansion under the National Solar Mission. 
Despite its potential and growth, challenges such as land availability, transmission infrastructure, and climate risks bring substantial impacts on solar power production. Impacts of climate risks on the solar PV efficiency are especially serious in the context of climate change., Changes in local climate variables such as temperature, humidity, and irradiance can directly affect solar PV efficiency. For example, high irradiance can enhance energy output (Duffie & Beckman, 2013), while extreme temperatures can reduce PV panel performance (Dubey et al., 2013). Other influences include dust, humidity, and precipitation. Among all the 
climate risks,fast-increasing temperature was found to be the key factor in efficiency loss (Skoplaki & Palyvos, 2009). 
Those climate risks necessitate adaptive strategies to ensure the reliability and sustainability of solar power in the face of a changing climate, where first and foremost is to understand how warming climate will affect solar PV efficiency and what are the associated impacts on solar PV production in India. This research will assess how climate change affects solar PV efficiency using modeling and simulations to analyze temperature, humidity, and irradiance effects. The findings will inform energy management strategies and enhance the resilience of renewable systems amid climate challenges.
